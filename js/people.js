The complexity of these networks is compounded by their dynamic nature in both space and time. Unfortunately, current technologies are insufficient to interrogate and reproduce protein signals with the spatiotemporal resolution at which they occur in nature, thus limiting our ability to understand them. We aim to engineer novel protein systems to enable photoactivation of various signaling proteins. Successful development of such light-inducible tools will provide unprecedented fine control over protein signal duration, intensity and location within living cells and tissues. Varying these parameters and observing the corresponding biological outputs will help illuminate how signalling dynamics determine cell fate. Identifying these input-output relationships is of great interest to the field of stem cell engineering, where properly manipulating cellular environments and signals will allow the efficient generation of therapeutically relevant target cell types.","Project group":"","Project supervisor":"","Nickname":"","Img Type":"jpg"},

Of particular interest are midbrain dopaminergic neurons because degeneration or loss of function of these neurons is associated with Parkinson's disease. Many protocols used to direct hESCs to develop into dopaminergic neurons are highly inefficient, or use co-culture systems of hESCs with cells of animal origin which prevents any downstream clinical application due to possible transfer of animal cells and pathogens. Also, most of these strategies employ classical two-dimensional culturing conditions for neuronal and dopaminergic induction which have limited relevance to the native three-dimensional conditions. Other major challenges that must be overcome to realize the therapeutic potential of hESC-derived dopaminergic neurons are poor survival and integration upon transplantation. To overcome these obstacles, we aim to design defined three-dimensional biological systems functionalized with bioactive components including recently identified midbrain patterning molecules and neurotrophic factors to support efficient dopaminergic differentiation of hESCs ex vivo. These cellular scaffolds are also designed to act as a temporary extracellular matrix after transplantation to enhance the survival and functional integration in vivo to meet the requirements for cell-based strategies for brain repair.","Project group":"","Project supervisor":"","Nickname":"","Img Type":"jpg"},
